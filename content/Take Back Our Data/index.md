This set of mini-posts presents different methods to **TAKE BACK OUR DATA**, ranging from new product ideas to regulatory measures to standard building. I'll be releasing final write-ups over the next few weeks, and will be updating draft versions of them here. 

You can consider these ideas MIT Licensed -- they are free for anyone to build out MVPs, ship to prod, start a company around, etc. My only ask is that you credit me for any ideas you use + reach out to me@vivs.wiki or DM me on [Twitter](https://x.com/viv_boop) if you start building! I want to collaborate and support in any way I can!
