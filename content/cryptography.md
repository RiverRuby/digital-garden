In my words, **cryptography** is a discipline combining ideas from mathematics and computer science to make things that are hard to break.

I've been lucky enough to work in cryptography since early 2016, working on an early PoW alternative called Proof-of-Space as a part of a research program called [MIT Primes](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php). The scheme involved Merkle queries on a large **hard-to-pebble graph** to prove that you'd stored a significant portion of the graph on your hard drive.

I now work primarily on [[ZK]] tech, supported by the [[PSE]] (Privacy & Scaling Explorations) team at the Ethereum Foundation, exploring the intersection of NFC and ZK as a way to bring private data [[ownership]] to regular people.

## Why do I like cryptography?

Cryptography is a precise art form. It is the art of taking precisely articulated primitives and assumptions and building overpowered superstructures on top of them. This starts with ideas as simple as OTPs (one time pads) but can also yield juggernauts like [[ZK]] and [[FHE]].  My experience taking [6.875](https://mit6875.github.io/fall2021.html) in 2019 illuminated this best for me, but I feel it every time I learn about a newly developed cryptosystem. 

It is ideal for brains that endeavor to understand every building block of what they're using. And it rewards those able to get deep enough into the weeds with novel insights and practical ways to wield the technology.

Cryptography is also [[open-source]] by nature, which I love. If your cryptography can't be scrutinized and attacked and critiqued, it isn't real. This necessitates your math and code being open source and ready for anyone to use. This creates a naturally open and positive-sum ecosystem, which feels very good.

It's also super math heavy, and I fucking love math. It's the purest art form humans have found. Every day I get to learn new math is a great one.
