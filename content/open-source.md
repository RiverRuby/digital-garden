Openly available for all to use. Very good vibes. [[CG]] is by nature open-source, if you can't verify the cryptography it is the same as trusting some guys at Google.[^a]

[^a]: There's some nuance here that is often not discussed by cryptography nerds. Even if it is open-source, you are still basically trusting some guys at (XYZ Auditing Firm) to have read the stuff correctly. Cryptography isn't really as pure as nerds would want you to believe it is. It all boils down to human trust. But an even stronger measure of strength is just...time. If a cryptosystem (smart contract, encryption, ZK proof) can last long enough without significant breaks, it is likely secure! Or it needs more scrutiny / financial incentives to break.
