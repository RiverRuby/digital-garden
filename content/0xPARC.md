The organization that funded my early journey through the applied ZK space. Co-led by [[Ludens]] and [[gubsheep]]. Website is at https://0xparc.org. Almost entirely funded by the [[EF]] but is not officially a part of the EF.  In my understanding, it has two main halves:

- [[AW]] half led by [[Ludens]] that includes [Lattice](https://lattice.xyz) and [AW Network](https://aw.network)
- [[CG]] half led by [[gubsheep]] that primarily includes [Zupass](https://zupass.org) (and [EZKL](https://ezkl.xyz) in some capacity?)

I am very grateful to 0xPARC and its leadership for early support and so much personal inspiration.
