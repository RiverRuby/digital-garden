[SXG](https://web.dev/articles/signed-exchanges) is one of the most promising methods for getting interesting signatures. This idea is originally from Jason Morton at SBC 2022. Roughly, we get signed HTML pages. This means we can definitely make proofs about publicly accessible information. There is this clause in the above document that I don't quite understand, would love to discuss with anyone interested:
>  Any potentially identifying information is hidden until after the user navigates to a site thereby protecting the user’s privacy.

How does this work? Do websites need to specify what parts of their site are private? I have no idea.
