[[Very cracked]]. Here's a WIP list of important [[ZK]] and [[cryptography]] things that Barry is  inventor, co-inventor, or major supporter of:
- [[Semaphore]]
- [RLN](https://ethresear.ch/t/semaphore-rln-rate-limiting-nullifier-for-spam-prevention-in-anonymous-p2p-setting/5009)
- [UniRep](https://ethresear.ch/t/anonymous-reputation-risking-and-burning/3926)
- [MACI](https://maci.pse.dev/)
	- [[Vitalik]] originally proposed [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413)
	- But Barry did the first implementation and PSE supports the current production instance
- [zk-Rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/roll-up-roll-back-snark-side-chain-17000-tps/3675)
	- The primary method by which Ethereum will scale to do any interesting computation, and the only PMF that applied ZK has found (so far)
- [zkEVMs](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits)
	- Rolling up an entire EVM inside a ZK proof, absolute madness at the time but actually became a reality
	- PSE supports the main open-source Type-1 zkEVM implementation
		- I believe Scroll has based part of their implementation on this public good, as well as contributing back
- [[Baby jubjub]]
	- He was the person who suggested we switch to it for our NFC experiments, changing the course of our projects and what we could prove efficiently
- [Lookup singularity](https://zkresear.ch/t/lookup-singularity/65)
	- I initially thought this was the silliest idea ever LOL but I was completely wrong
	- Helped inspire [Lasso](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/Lasso-paper.pdf), one of the most promising lookup tools available to ZK today
- [[PSE]]
	- Barry is the team lead of Privacy & Scaling Explorations, a group at the Ethereum Foundation
