Binius is a new SNARK from November 2023 that operates on binary fields.

There are a number of very interesting theoretical improvements that Binius makes over previous works. But what I am most interested in is its ability to more efficiently arithmetize standard hash functions like SHA and Keccak, and for the operations involved in generating the SNARK also being hardware-friendly hash functions like SHA and Keccak.
