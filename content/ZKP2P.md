[ZKP2P](https://zkp2p.xyz) is a super fascinating project. In my reading, it is the first project to incentivize private data [[ownership]] with money. Specifically, by being a Venmo LP and making ZK proofs of Venmo emails, you can collect a % fee for the service you're providing of on-ramping people to the chain. And this is only possible because you have [[VIP]] data in the form of DKIM signatures on your venmo emails!

It's the first on-ramping tool we have to platforms like [[DKIM-BIN]], which I will write more about soon.
