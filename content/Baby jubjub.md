ZK-friendly elliptic curve, defined best in [ERC-2494](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2494). Baby jubjub ECDSA is faster than EdDSA due to tricks from [[efficient-ecdsa]]! ECDSA is also much more hardware native in NFC chips like [[Javacards]], which formed the backbone of [[Jubmoji]]!

Ditch EdDSA...even [[Barry WhiteHat]] regretted its usage, and he's part of the reason we're stuck with BBJJ EdDSA all over the place!
