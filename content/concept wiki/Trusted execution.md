I'm not excited about solutions that lean on TEEs but I think they are important to explore. For people who understand & believe cryptography, TEEs are less deeply verifiable than solutions like [[ZK]], where you can always read the circuit yourself and generate the zkey/vkey yourself.

But if we are being reasonable, they seem to provide the same client guarantee of:
> Trust us, some really smart fucking people checked that this proof was hard to forge

Will average users have the education / applications have the communication to make solutions built on ZKPs feel more safe / crucial than solutions built on TEEs? I am not sure. I think it is very important we figure out what people care about, and see what different types of applications each technology enables.
