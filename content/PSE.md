Privacy and Scaling Explorations Team, website at https://pse.dev. Subteam of [[EF]]. Technical lead is [[Barry WhiteHat]]. 

In my opinion, PSE stands out as one of the most unique technical organizations ever assembled. I will write more about this later. Many similarities to [[Org 0xPARC]], many differences too!  I am very, very excited to see PSE's eventual [[Wikipedia]] page! It occupies a crucial place in the history of [[ZK]] so far, and [[CG]] in general.

## PSE projects
Far from complete, see https://pse.dev/projects for the entire list! I am just featuring those that are a part of this wiki so far.
- [[Semaphore]]
- [[ZuStamps]]
- [[Jubmoji grant proposal]]
- [[Denver ZK Quests]]
