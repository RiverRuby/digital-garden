This is one of my favorite projects so far! Repo at https://github.com/RiverRuby/heyauthn

The app all came together code-wise in about a week, but was built from months of different connections all coming together at once. It was (as far as I know) the first time three important technologies were paired with ZK:
1. WebAuthn (used to generate/store/persist Semaphore identities)
2. NFC (Disk from [IYK](https://iyk.app) used to create a group at an in-person event)
3. ZK-anon Discord question bot (used for questions during the presentation)

Attached is the slideshow used at the [MIT ZK IAP](https://zkiap.com) course final presentations:
