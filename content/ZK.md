Zero-knowledge cryptography, primarily built from [[zkSNARKs]]. There are three main properties that we unlock with ZK:

1. Succinctness (the `S` in [[zkSNARK]])
	- Usually used for scalability, as in zkRollups (which usually don't use any ZK)
2. Verifiability (the `NARK` in [[zkSNARK]])
	- Equivalent to [[VIP]]
3. Privacy (the `zk` in [[zkSNARK]])
	- Can enable true data [[ownership]] in a way that hasn't been possible for the first few innings of the internet
