Authenticity is highly related to [[VIP]] data, but I believe is a more directed towards “is this piece of content real?” Whether that be
1. Really from a camera
2. Really from a government official
3. Really from your friend
4. Really from an AI
5. Really regulatory approved

Digital [[signatures]] provide authenticity.
