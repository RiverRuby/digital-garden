The organization that funded my early journey through the applied ZK space. Co-led by [[Ludens]] and [[gubsheep]]. Website is at https://0xparc.org

In my understanding, it has two halves:

1. [[autonomous worlds]] half led by [[Ludens]] that includes [Lattice](https://lattice.xyz) and [AW Network](https://aw.network)
2. [[cryptography]] half led by [[gubsheep]] that primarily includes [Zupass](https://zupass.org) and [EZKL](https://ezkl.xyz) in some capacity

I am very grateful for 0xPARC and its leadership for early support and so much personal inspiration. Very excited to see the evolution of this organization and hope it has a banger [[Wikipedia page]].
