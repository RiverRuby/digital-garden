One of the great perks of working in [[CG]]-adjacent worlds (mostly web3 and blockchain, but [[ZK]] is on the rise!) is that it's quite global. In many ways, the best users of this technology do not live in more privileged countries, so on a distribution level it is crucial to spend time in other places and present the technology there.
