Short for "account abstraction", the ERC-4337 version. It's a promising way of making blockchain easier to use, but it fully avoids web3's fundamental problem: *there are very few interesting things to do once you make it on-chain*. Having better onboarding and more blockspace does not solve this much, much harder problem. I think [[AW]] are one solution / more productive framing for the space to tackle, but all AWs are nascent and haven't shown significant promise.
