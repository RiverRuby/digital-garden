title: About me

**River Ruby** is a stage name for technical work from Vivek Bhupatiraju. Inspired by artist names in music and pseudonyms like Barry WhiteHat, River is an alter ego for the parts of my personality that are **more mathematical and computational oriented.**

\`\`**River**" is a new name I've been going by this year. It sounds like the way I've chosen to pronounce my name: "vih-vih-k", "rih-vih-r". [^1] I love how 'River' communicates constant movement and tranquility at the same time, a balance I hope to achieve in life.

\`\`**Ruby**'' is my birthstone, and my favorite gem overall. I've always been obsessed with the color red, as this hopefully makes clear. It also matches my jubmoji [[ðŸ”º]], which was a coincidence too good to not lean into.

But also, who knows, maybe this isn't right for me. I'm just FAFOing!

[^1]: Notably, this pronunciation is different from the more traditional pronunciation of "vih-vay-k", which you may have seen a certain presidential candidate use.
