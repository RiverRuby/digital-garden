title: About me
---

**River Ruby** is a stage name for technical work from Vivek Bhupatiraju. Inspired by artist names in music and pseudonyms like Barry WhiteHat, River is an alter ego for the parts of my humanity that are **mathematical and computational.**

\`\`**River**" is a new name I've been going by this year[^1]. It sounds like the way I've chosen to pronounce my name: "vih-vih-k".[^2]  Other things I like about "River":
- Constantly changing -> always flowing, always growing, always learning
- Tranquil, pristine -> i gotta find peace of mind![^3]

\`\`**Ruby**'' is my birthstone, and my favorite gem overall. And I've always been obsessed with the color red, as this website hopefully makes clear. It also matches my first jubmoji [[ðŸ”º]], which was a coincidence too good to not lean into!

But also, who knows, maybe this isn't right for me. Maybe I'll change everything. I'm just FAFOing!

[^1]: By this I mean I use it at coffee shops and see how baristas react to a person that looks like me being named river.
[^2]: Notably, this pronunciation is different from the more traditional pronunciation of "vih-vay-k", which you may have seen a certain presidential candidate use. That's the proper Indian way of pronunciation, one that my parents use for me. I never liked when other people used that for me though?
