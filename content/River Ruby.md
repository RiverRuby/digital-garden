title: River Ruby
---
**River Ruby** is a pen name for technical work from V✨✨✨✨ Bhupatiraju. Inspired by artist names like Daniel Caesar and pseudonyms like [[Barry WhiteHat]], River is an alter ego for the parts of my humanity that are **mathematical and computational.**

- \`\`**River**" is a new name I've been going by this year[^1]. It sounds like the way I've chosen to pronounce my name: "vih-vih-k".[^2]  Other things I like about "River":
	- Constantly changing -> always flowing, always growing, always learning
	- Tranquil, pristine -> i gotta find peace of mind![^3]

- \`\`**Ruby**'' is my birthstone, and my favorite gem overall. And I've always been obsessed with the color red, as this website hopefully makes clear. It also matches my first jubmoji [[🔺]], which was a coincidence too good to not lean into!

It feels much easier to present my technical ideas while in a distinct identity. It's not that they're offensive or otherwise negative LOL, it's just nice to have a clean split from the other interests in my life (primarily [[music]] & [[decor]]) instead of trying to present one cohesive narrative. It also focuses the content of each of my different outlets, providing a cleaner consumption experience all around.

But also, who knows, maybe this isn't right for me. Maybe I'll change everything. I'm just FAFOing[^4]!

[^1]: By this I mean I've been using it at coffee shops to see how baristas react to a person that looks like me being named River. It seems to cause mild confusion, but most people don't care lol. Which feels great!

[^2]: Notably, this pronunciation is different from the more traditional pronunciation of "vih-vay-k", which you may have seen a certain presidential candidate use. That's the proper Indian way of pronunciation, one that my parents use for me. I never liked when other people used that for me though?
