ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§ 

Despite all the hype, AI still feels underrated[^1]. It will so clearly change everything beyond our current understanding, and the movement is only accelerating.

An increasingly urgent sense I am getting is that **AI will increase the "[[offensive]]" powers of individual humans and other AIs to a deafening level**. In this world, [[defensive]] technologies will actually become [[offensive]], as a way to shield and filter our vision and our perception and our world from digital junk and misinformation.

In that sense, [[AI]] has a natural pairing with [[CG]], and I am very excited to explore this intersection in 2024 and onwards.

I think [[signatures]] are our first and most important line of defense/offense against AI. As a way to connect data to real humans or trusted institutions and filter our information to [[VIP]] sources. [[ZK]] makes a killer pairing with signatures, as we can use ZK to make complex and private computations over signatures to prove more useful predicates about data.

## AI project proposals

> [[SXG]] proofs & lobbying
- This website signs its data with SXG!
- I want to make proofs about what I say on other parts of the web!
- And then let's do it for your website (and Medium, Substack, Mirror, and all major media sites...once we lobby them all to also add SXG!)
- Specifically to prove that data did not come from an AI, but from a real human author
- We are running out of time to join the anonymity set of "real human writers" on these platforms LOL

> Technical support with Morpheus implementation
- Promising attempt at watermarking AI produced content, led by [[yush]]  and [Daniel Bessenov](https://danielb.co/)
- Uses perceptual hashes
- Stability AI has expressed interest in implementation & testing
