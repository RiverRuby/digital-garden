The [[PSE]] grant proposal and original specification for this project can be found here: [[Jubmoji grant proposal]]. The original technical ideas forming the core of the Jubmoji project can be found here: [[Project Vinyl]].
## High-level
- 2023 activation at Zu/Devconnect using NFC cards that produce unique baby jubjub signatures upon tap to privately digitize in-person experiences
- Signatures were represented as "jubmojis"
	- Jub = [[Baby jubjub]] elliptic curve
		- Using this curve in NFCwas the main technical advancement this project made
		- A shoutout to one of its inventors + suggestor , [[PSE]] team lead [[Barry WhiteHat]]
	- Emoji = succinct representation of card public key, akin to ENS for ethereum address
- Developed a "quests" feature where users could make proofs about their collection of "jubmojis"
- Unlocked "powers" upon completing quests
	- Event tickets, access to group chats, in-person prizes if redeemed
- Version 1 was [Sigmoji](https://github.com/jubmoji/nfctap.xyz), used at SBC and the Funding the Commons Berlin residency
