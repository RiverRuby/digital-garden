VIP = verifiable, interoperable, portable

I think these are three equivalent notions, that all follow from each other. In different contexts, it is best to use one of the three terms over the others. I personally resonate most with **portability** over the others, partially also because it has less of its own brand within web3.

## Verifiability


## Interoperability


## Portability

	- Authenticity is often what we are looking to "verify" when we are leveraging verifiability. 
- [[ownership]]
	- If you have private VIP data, you own it in a meaningful way
	- Don't need anyone else to store and attest to it; you can make those proofs yourself and hide the core elements
- [[signatures]]
	- Signatures are the smallest/simplest unit of VIP data
- [[ZK]]
	- ZK proofs are a significant up-level of VIP data, where we can selectively disclose information and make the proof highly succinct
