title: Welcome!

My name is [[River Ruby]] or [[ðŸ”º]] for short. This digital garden contains my thoughts on technology, primarily those concerning [[cryptography]] and [[autonomous worlds]]. I will occasionally write about other topics, so stay tuned!

Everything in this garden is a work-in-progress, and very open to feedback! I will occasionally publish specific pieces, but expect those pieces to be changed over time as I learn more. And there will certainly be pages that are incomplete or just have a sentence that ends abruptly -- I get distracted easily and hop around many pages when I write. If you want to discuss something further or suggest a correction, please email me@riverruby.xyz and I would love to chat or

I am on a mission to never lose touch with my [[inner child]]. I am a huge nerd and easily excitable. My favorite activity is to listen to other nerds nerd out about random shit they love. Doesn't have to be anything I know about, I just feed off of genuine passion. If that resonates, reach out! Let's be nerds together.

## Projects

### In-flight

- (**12/23 to present**) [[ZK Quests]] and [[jubsignal]]
	- Funded by PSE
	- 2024 activation at ETHDenver using e2e encrypted baby jubjub signatures
	- Uses NFC cards to share an ECDH public key to send encrypted
- **(08/23 to present)** [[Jubmoji]]
	- Funded by PSE, project & design led by Rachel and technology led by me
	- 2023 activation at Zu/Devconnect using NFC cards that produce unique baby jubjub signatures upon tap to privately digitize in-person experiences
	- Developed a "quests" feature that
- **(07/23 to present)** [[Data guilds]]
	- Using ZK to take back data ownership & ad revenue in a privacy-preserving and public goods-oriented way

### Proposals

- DKIM-BIN
	- Expanding zk-email into a more substantial identity platform
	- Building a separate email service  
- sha-maphore
	- Application of Binius
	- Using SHA256 + Semaphore as a signature algorithm
	- Quantum resistant, using standard hash functions, recursion friendly
- ZK extension to This Cursed Machine
	- Users can create "secret materials" by uploading a hash of a material/machine path
	- Users can unlock secret material by ZK proving knowledge of the path's pre-image

### Recent

- (**06/23 to 08/23**) [[Project Vinyl]]
	- Independent exploration into continuations of NFC projects
	- Ideas were converted into the [[Jubmoji]] PSE grant proposal!

	- Funded by 0xPARC, project led by me
	- First deployment of NFC chips
- **(04/23 to 05/23)** [Zupoll](https://zupoll.org)
	- Funded by 0xPARC, collaborated with Sampriti
	- [Developed a polling app](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupoll) built on Semaphore for Zuzalu citizens to use for polls
	- Don't think the privacy benefits outweigh the UX costs unfortunately
- (**02/23 to 04/23**) [Zupass](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass) and PCD SDK
	- Funded by 0xPARC, working with Brian, Ivan, DC
	- One of three full-time developers on the Zupass team
- (**02/23 to 04/23**) [[WebAuthn]] ZK research
	- Funded by 0xPARC/PSE, project led by Richard and proposed/supported by me
	- Creating [ZK circuits](https://github.com/zkwebauthn/webauthn-halo2) to prove knowledge of a valid WebAuthn signature
	- Applied for use in an [AA wallet](https://www.noseedphrases.xyz/)
- (**01/23 to 02/23**) [heyauthn!](https://github.com/RiverRuby/heyauthn)
	- Demo using [[WebAuthn]] to power Semaphore identities
	- Also used NFC chips to create Semaphore groups, first documented use of NFC for ZK
- (**01/23 to 02/23**) MIT [ZK IAP](https://zkiap.com) instructor and TA
	- Funded by 0xPARC
	- Lecturer for Session 4 and partial lecturer for Session 11
