Hi there, I'm Vivek! This [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) and occasional blog contains my thoughts on technology and documentation of my [projects](/In-flight-projects). I primarily explore **cryptography research** ([[CG]]), but I also write about **autoworlds** ([[AW]]), **artificial intelligence** ([[AI]]), and other technical intrigues! I am hoping that this site becomes a resource for anyone to understand complex technology in a **friendly but deeply informative way**.

All writing here is a work-in-progress, and very open to feedback! There are many pieces that are incomplete or half-baked -- I get distracted easily and hop around many pages when I write. If you want to discuss something further, suggest a correction, or suggest a topic to write about, please email me@vivs.wiki or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viv_boop)! I also go by [vivboop](https://t.me/vivboop) or [[River Ruby]] on other parts of the web.

I am on a mission to never lose touch with my [[inner child]]. I am a huge nerd and easily excitable. My favorite activity is to listen to other nerds nerd out about random shit they love. Doesn't have to be anything I know about, I just feed off of genuine passion. If that resonates, reach out! Let's be nerds together.

## Selected blog posts

- [[Data guilds]]
- [[CG]] or Why I like cryptography
- [[SXG]] or Signed web pages

## Projects

Compilations of various projects that have shaped the technologist I currently am. It's a mix of applied research, e2e products, and academic work.

- [[In-flight projects]]
- [[Selected past projects]]
- [[All past projects]]

## Project proposals

All of these ideas are works-in-progress; I will properly publish + promote them when they are finished. But if any of them resonate or you know of similar work, please reach out!
