title: Welcome!

My name is [[River Ruby]] or [[ðŸ”º]] for short. This [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) contains my thoughts on technology. I will primarily be exploring [[cryptography]], but I will also write about [[autoworlds]], [[AI]], and other technical intrigues!

All writing here is a work-in-progress, and very open to feedback! There are many pieces that are incomplete or half-baked -- I get distracted easily and hop around many pages when I write. If you want to discuss something further, suggest a correction, or suggest a topic to write about, please email me@riverruby.xyz!

I am on a mission to never lose touch with my [[inner child]]. I am a huge nerd and easily excitable. My favorite activity is to listen to other nerds nerd out about random shit they love. Doesn't have to be anything I know about, I just feed off of genuine passion. If that resonates, reach out! Let's be nerds together.

## Proposals

All of these ideas are works-in-progress; I will properly publish + promote them when they are finished. But if any of them resonate or you know of similar work, please reach out!

## Past work 

Compilations of various projects that have shaped the technologist I am. It's a mix of applied research, e2e products, and academic work.
