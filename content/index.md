Hi there, I'm Vivek! This [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) contains my thoughts on technology. I will primarily be exploring **cryptography research** ([[CG]]), but I will also write about **autoworlds** ([[AW]]), **artificial intelligence** ([[AI]]), and other technical intrigues! Here is a collection of past projects for a taste of my interests: [[Selected past projects]]

All writing here is a work-in-progress, and very open to feedback! There are many pieces that are incomplete or half-baked -- I get distracted easily and hop around many pages when I write. If you want to discuss something further, suggest a correction, or suggest a topic to write about, please email me@vivs.wiki! I also go by [vivboop](https://twitter.com/viv_boop) or [[River Ruby]] on other parts of the web.

I am on a mission to never lose touch with my [[inner child]]. I am a huge nerd and easily excitable. My favorite activity is to listen to other nerds nerd out about random shit they love. Doesn't have to be anything I know about, I just feed off of genuine passion. If that resonates, reach out! Let's be nerds together.

- Currently expecting 18,000 attendees!

> [[Jubmoji]] (August '23 to present)

- Funded by [[PSE]], project & design led by Rachel, technology led by me
- 2023 activation at Zu/Devconnect using NFC cards that produce unique [[Baby jubjub]] [[signatures]] upon tap

- Joint work with [[yush]] and Lily Jordan
- Using [[ZK]] to take back data [[ownership]] & ad revenue in a privacy-preserving and public goods-oriented way
- _Looking for collaborators and aligned funding!_

## Proposals

All of these ideas are works-in-progress; I will properly publish + promote them when they are finished. But if any of them resonate or you know of similar work, please reach out!

- [[CG#Cryptography project proposals]]
- [[AW#AW project proposals]]
- [[AI#AI project proposals]]

## Past work

Compilations of various projects that have shaped the technologist I am. It's a mix of applied research, e2e products, and academic work.
