title: Welcome!

My name is [[River Ruby]] or [[ðŸ”º]] for short. This digital garden contains my thoughts on technology. Primarily I will explore [[cryptography]], but I will also write about [[autonomous worlds]], [[artificial intelligence]], and other technical intrigues!

Everything here is a work-in-progress, and very open to feedback! I will occasionally publish specific pieces, but expect those pieces to be changed over time as I learn more. And there will certainly be pages that are incomplete or just have a sentence that ends abruptly -- I get distracted easily and hop around many pages when I write. If you want to discuss something further or suggest a correction, please email me@riverruby.xyz and I would love to chat or

I am on a mission to never lose touch with my [[inner child]]. I am a huge nerd and easily excitable. My favorite activity is to listen to other nerds nerd out about random shit they love. Doesn't have to be anything I know about, I just feed off of genuine passion. If that resonates, reach out! Let's be nerds together.

## Proposals

All of these ideas are works-in-progress; I will properly publish + promote them when they are finished. But if any of them resonate or you know of similar work, please reach out!

## Past work 
A compilation of various projects that have shaped the technologist I am and want to be. It's a mix of applied research, e2e products, and academic work.
