My name is [[River Ruby]] or [[ðŸ”º]] for short. This digital garden contains my thoughts on technology, primarily those concerning [[cryptography]] and [[autonomous worlds]]. I will occasionally write about other topics, so stay tuned!

Everything in this garden is a work-in-progress, and very open to feedback! I will occasionally publish specific pieces, but expect those pieces to be changed over time as I learn more. And there will certainly be pages that are incomplete or just have a sentence that ends abruptly -- I get distracted easily and hop around many pages when I write. If you want to discuss something further or suggest a correction, please email me@riverruby.xyz and I would love to chat or

I am on a mission to never lose touch with my [[inner child]]. I am a huge nerd and easily excitable. My favorite activity is to listen to other nerds nerd out about random shit they love. Doesn't have to be anything I know about, I just feed off of genuine passion. If that resonates, reach out! Let's be nerds together.

## In-flight projects

> **December '23 to present**: [[ZK Quests]] and [[jubsignal]]
- Funded by [[PSE]]
- 2024 activation at ETHDenver using e2e encrypted baby jubjub signatures
- Uses NFC cards to share an ECDH public key to send encrypted data P2P to maintain [[ownership]] and build [[VIP]] data

> **August '23 to present**: [[Jubmoji]]
- Funded by [[PSE]], project & design led by Rachel, technology led by me
- 2023 activation at Zu/Devconnect using NFC cards that produce unique baby jubjub signatures upon tap to privately digitize in-person experiences

> **July '23 to present**: [[Data guilds]]
- Joint work with [[yush]] and Lily Jordan
- Using ZK to take back data ownership & ad revenue in a privacy-preserving and public goods-oriented way
- Looking for collaborators and aligned funding!
## Proposals

All of these documents are a work-in-progress; I will properly publish them when they are finished. But if any of them resonate or you know of similar work, please reach out!

> [[SXG]] proofs & lobbying
- This website signs its data with SXG!
- I want to make proofs about what River says on other parts of the web!
- And then let's do it for your website (and Medium, Substack, Mirror, and all major media sites...once we lobby them all to also add SXG!)
	  
> [[SHAmaphore]]
- Using SHA256 + Semaphore as a signature algorithm
	- I am a SHA256 lover over Keccak, fight me
- Quantum resistant, using standard hash functions, recursion friendly, hell yes
- Good bye Poseidon!!

> [[DKIM-BIN]]
- Current UX of zk-email is too poor to enable any useful applications building on private emails
- Create a more substantial platform that automatically & privately parses incoming emails to extract useful ZK proofs
	  
> ZK extension to This Cursed Machine
- Users can create "secret materials" by uploading a hash of a material/machine path
- Users can unlock secret material by ZK proving knowledge of the path's pre-image
