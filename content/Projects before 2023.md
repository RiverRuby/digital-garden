#### 2022
- **(11/22 to 01/23)** [Right-field secp256k1 ECDSA research](https://personaelabs.org/posts/spartan-ecdsa/)
  - Funded by Personae Labs, collaborated with Dan Tehrani
  - Avoiding wrong-field arithmetic all together by using a zkSNARK that operates on finite fields that aren't FFT friendly
  - Focused on [Halo2-IPA combined with ECFFT](https://github.com/personaelabs/halo2-secp), unfortunately this was quite difficult and Dan's work with Spartan ended up being successful
- **(09/22 to 11/22)** [[efficient-ecdsa]]
  - Funded by Personae Labs, collaborated with Dan Tehrani
  - Developed in an ETH research post
- **(08/22 to 10/22)** [[In-person heyanon]]
  - Funded by 0xPARC and Personae Labs
  - Used heyanon to build
- **(03/22 to 11/22)** [[heyanon!]]
  - Funded by 0xPARC and Personae Labs, collaborated with Lakshman Sankar

- (**01/19 to 04/19**) Cryptography Quant Research
	- Job at a (now defunct, lol) crypto hedge fund called Virgil Capital
	- Researched underlying cryptoeconomics of prominent DeFi platforms like MakerDAO and Compound to develop trading strategies
- **(01/17 to 08/18)** Authenticated data structures research
	- Member of Devadas Lab at MIT, advised by Alin Tomescu
	- Researched and developed efficient append-only authenticated dictionaries, published in [ACM CCS '19](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345652)
	- Applications to certificate authorities and public-key directories
	- Clever combination of KZG polynomial commitments and binary tree structures
- (**01/16 to 12/16**) Consensus research
